MOODSWING is an RGBW leddriver with a ESP32-WROVER module.
I already hear you asking: "Do we need *another* Wifi LED-lamp project?" But MOODSWING is not like the other gazillions of Wifi LED-lamps!

This board packs some interesting features:
+ Did I mention it is a RGB __W__  controller? This means 4 channels and the ability to create much nice bright white light.
+ Want to make the light portable? The LED drivers run from one or more 18650 Li-Ion cells. Add as many as your heart desires. There is a onboard charger and battery protection included. 5 small LEDs indicate the state of the battery charge.
+ The board packs high efficiency switching drivers. Say no to wasted heat in linear drivers! More effeciency means longer battery life.
